# Gift Giver

This is an app created from a TDD with React course.

The Gift Giver app keeps track of gift ideas by adding new gifts and assigning them to a person.

The app was built with a fully TDD approach using Jest and Enzyme.

[Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/) was added to make the interface look better than no styling.
